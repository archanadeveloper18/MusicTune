# MusicTune
MusicTune App have list of songs, with play and pause button.

MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

->The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.


->The purpose of each activity is easy for a user to understand through the UI design and feature labeling.

->The app contains 2 to 6 activities

->The app contains multiple activities, each labelled, which together make a cohesive music app.

->Features in the app are clearly defined either by labelling or images. For example, a button to play music could use a universally recognized triangular "Play" symbol or could have the text label "Play".


->Each activity contains button(s) which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘Library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘Now Playing’ activity.



Functionality

->The code runs without errors

->Each button’s behavior is determined by an OnClickListener in the Java code rather than by the android:onClick attribute in the XML Layout.


->Each button properly opens the intended activity using an explicit Intent.

->App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class.

->Information about instances of the custom class are stored in an appropriate data structure (e.g. ArrayList, Array).

->When the information needs to be displayed, it is efficiently retrieved (e.g. Looping).

->Data about each song (or equivalent audio media such as podcast episode) should be stored in a custom class that contains at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name)

->If images are included (e.g. Album Art), they are stored as drawables. All drawables are stored at multiple densities. Images are not required.
